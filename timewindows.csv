,,,Breakfast for site1,Lunch for site 1,Earliest meal that exists ,Convert earliest meal time to hours,How many hours until the meal begins (assuming we're currently at 6 am),How many hours early we can deliver the meal (some missing values),"Same as previous column, but missing values means we can deliver the meal 30 minutes early at most","This is the important one. Defines lower bound for the time window we can deliver the meals. If it says like 1 then that means we can deliver the meal at most 1 hour after 6 am so 7 am. Notice that we ignore negative time windows, that means if we can deliver the meal before 6am we just assume we can deliver it earliest at 6am. ","This is the other important one, it's the upper bound. It shows us the latest we can deliver a meal. So if says like 1.25, that means the latest we can deliver the meal here is 1.25 hours after 6 so like 7:15",,
